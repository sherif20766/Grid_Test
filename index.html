        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>You are required to write a program which accepts a user location as a pair of co-ordinates, and returns a list of the five closest events, along with the cheapest ticket price for each event</p>

        <p>Q: What assumptions have you made?
        <br>
        A: That there is a 50% chance of an event occuring at any point on the grid
        </p>
        <p>Q: How might you change your program if you needed to support multiple events at the same location?
        <br>
        A: Would add more events to the coord[i][j] Object in the grid creation and modify the code on line 77 of main.js to also include the various events and their respective prices when appending 
        </p>
        <p>Q: How would you change your program if you were working with a much larger world size?
        <br>
        A: I would suggest using NodeJS and a suitable database to store all the data, streamlining the code and making it more efficient for larger ("realworld") use
